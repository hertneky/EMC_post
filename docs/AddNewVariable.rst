Adding a New Variable
*********************

This document provides general procedures and an example of how to add
a new variable to the UPP code. Please keep in mind it may not be an
exhaustive step-by-step depending on your particular situation. While we
can provide general assistance for adding a new variable, users should
be aware that this requires good knowledge of Fortran and thorough
understanding of the code.

We encourage users to contact us at upp-help@ucar.edu to make us aware
of modifications you are making. In some cases, if we determine the
changes you are making may be relevant for operational and/or community
purposes, we will be interested in incorporating your changes into the
code base for support and future release. We would then work with you to
make this possible.

The following outlines a brief description of the steps to be taken and
are described in more detail with examples in the sections below.

1.  Allocate the field: ALLOCATE.f
    *This file is the instantiation or allocation of the variable. Note that the variables
    are defined based on the parallel processing capability of UPP - use an example
    from the file.*

2.  Deallocate the field: DEALLOCATE.f
    *All good programmers give back their resources when they are done. Please
    update this routine to return your resource to the system.*

3.  Declare the new variable: VRBLS2D_mod.f, VRBLS3D_mod.f, or
    VRBLS4D_mod.f
    *The variable is declared in one of these modules defining files depending on its
    dimension.*

4.  Read model output: INITPOST.f
    *This file is used for reading the model output files.*

5.  Add to appropriate routine for filling the new variable:
    e.g. SURFCE.f, MDLFLD.f, MDL2P.f, etc
    *This is the place that you will fill the array with the data and call gribit to output
    the field.*

6.  Define table/grib2 parameters for grib2 output: params_grib2_tbl_new
    *This table contains the necessary parameter information for grib2 fields.*

7.  Define the field for grib2 output: post_avlbflds.xml
    *This file is used for defining all available grib2 fields.*

8.  Define control file entry for output: postcntrl.xml & postxconfig-NT.txt
    *These files are used for controlling which fields are output by UPP for grib2.*

=================
Example Procedure: Steps for adding the new variable ‘ACLHF’
=================
- This example illustrates a new variable from the WRF output that will be read into UPP
  and directly output into the grib output files (i.e. no additional computations/calculations
  are needed for the field).
- Additions to each of the routines are highlighted in green.
- Locations of routines are in /UPPV4.1/sorc/ncep_post.fd unless specified otherwise.
- A sample wrfout file for the following procedures is available for download from:
  - https://dtcenter.org/sites/default/files/community-code/AddNewVariableData.tar.gz
  - This data is the 6-hr forecast of a WRF initialization of 2009-12-17_12:00:00

    New variable to ad: ACLHF

    float ACLHF(Time, south_north, west_east) ;
          ACLHF:FieldType = 104 ;
          ACLHF:MemoryOrder = "XY " ;
          ACLHF:description = "ACCUMULATED UPWARD LATENT HEAT FLUX AT THE SURFACE" ;
          ACLHF:units = "J m-2" ;
          ACLHF:stagger = "" ;
          ACLHF:coordinates = "XLONG XLAT" ;

1. Allocate the new variable in ALLOCATE_ALL.f
   This file is the instantiation or allocation of the variable. Note that the variables are defined
   based on the parallel processing capability of UPP - use an example from the file.

   User Procedure:
   - Add in VRBLS2D section as:
     allocate(aclhf(im,jsta_2l:jend_2u))

2. De-allocate the variable to give the resources back in DEALLOCATE.f
   All good programmers give back their resources when they are done. Please update this
   routine to return your resource to the system.

   User procedure:
   - Add as:
     deallocate(aclhf)

3. Declare the new variable in the appropriate file depending on its dimensions;
   VRBLS2D_mod.f, VRBLS3D_mod.f or VRBLS4D_mod.f

   User procedure:
   - ACLHF is a 2-dimensional field, so declare it in VRBLS2D_mod.f
   - Add to the end of the first section of allocations as:
     ACLHF(:,:)

4. Read the model output field from the wrfout file by adding the new variable into INITPOST.F
   This file is used for reading the WRF-ARW model output files in netcdf format.

   User procedure:
   - Add using the 2D variable SNDEPAC (snowfall accumulation), which is also a 2D
   surface based accumulation field, as a template by following it through the routine.
   - Add to top section of the routine in ‘use vrbls2d’ to initiate the new variable as:
     aclhf
   - Read in the new variable as:
     VarName='ACLHF'
     call getVariable(fileName,DateStr,DataHandle,VarName,DUMMY, &
     IM,1,JM,1,IM,JS,JE,1)
     do j = jsta_2l, jend_2u
       do i = 1, im
         ACLHF ( i, j ) = dummy ( i, j )
       end do
     end do

5. Determine the correct routine to add the new variable to (e.g. SURFCE.f, MDLFLD.f,
   MDL2P.f, etc). You will need to determine the correct routine to add your field into; this is the
   place that you will fill the array with the data and call gribit to output the field. The correct routine
   will depend on what your field is. For example, if you have a new diagnostic called foo, and you
   want it interpolated to pressure levels, you would need to add it to MDL2P.f. If foo was only a
   surface variable, you would add it to SURFCE.f. If you wanted foo on native model levels, you
   would add it to MDLFLD.f. If you’re not sure which routine to add the new variable to, choose a
   similar variable as a template.

   Note: This is also where you would add any calculations needed for your new variable, should it
   be required.

   User procedure:
   - Treat ACLHF like a surface field (SURFCE.f)
   - Using the variable SNDEPAC (accumulated depth of snowfall) as a template which is
   also an accumulated field that is just being read through and output, similar to what we
   want.
   - Add in top section in ‘use vrbls2d, only’ to initiate the new variable as:
   aclhf
   - Add in main section using the template variable as a guide.
    - Note that ID(02), which is the ID for table version number, is added and set to 130.
      This is the table that we are adding the new variable to.
    -  The block of code in blue is for metadata for the accumulation field being added
       in this example and the user does not need to edit it and it is not always needed.
       For example, for an instantaneous field, you would not need that block.

   ! ACCUM UPWARD LATENT HEAT FLUX AT SURFACE
    IF (IGET(950).GT.0) THEN
      ID(1:25) = 0
      ID(02) = 130
      ITPREC = NINT(TPREC)
   !mp
      IF(ITPREC .NE. 0) THEN
        IFINCR = MOD(IFHR,ITPREC)
        IF(IFMIN .GE. 1)IFINCR = MOD(IFHR*60+IFMIN,ITPREC*60)
      ELSE
        IFINCR = 0
      ENDIF
   !mp
      ID(18) = 0
      ID(19) = IFHR
      IF(IFMIN .GE. 1)ID(19)=IFHR*60+IFMIN
      ID(20) = 4
      IF (IFINCR.EQ.0) THEN
        ID(18) = IFHR-ITPREC
      ELSE
        ID(18) = IFHR-IFINCR
        IF(IFMIN .GE. 1)ID(18)=IFHR*60+IFMIN-IFINCR
      ENDIF
      IF (ID(18).LT.0) ID(18) = 0
      if(grib=='grib1') then
        DO J=JSTA,JEND
          DO I=1,IM
            GRID1(I,J) = ACLHF(I,J)
          ENDDO
        ENDDO
        CALL GRIBIT(IGET(950),LVLS(1,IGET(950)), GRID1,IM,JM)
      elseif(grib=='grib2') then
        cfld=cfld+1
        fld_info(cfld)%ifld=IAVBLFLD(IGET(950))
        fld_info(cfld)%ntrange=1
        fld_info(cfld)%tinvstat=IFHR-ID(18)
   !$omp parallel do private(i,j,jj)
        do j=1,jend-jsta+1
          jj = jsta+j-1
          do i=1,im
            datapd(i,j,cfld) = ACLHF(i,jj)
          enddo
        enddo
      endif
    ENDIF

6. For grib2 output, add the new variable to /UPPV4.1/parm/params_grib2_tbl_new.
   For all current UPP output fields, this table lists, in order, the:
   - Discipline (http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/grib2/grib2_table0-0.shtml)
   - Category (http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/grib2/grib2_table4-1.shtml)
   - Parameter Number (http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/grib2/grib2_table4-2.shtml)
   - Table information (0 for parameters from the WMO table; 1 for parameters from the local
   NCEP table)
   - Abbreviated Variable Name (from the parameters table)

   User Procedure:
   - Since there is already a latent heat flux (LHTFL) parameter in this table, create a new
     Latent Heat Flux parameter so as to not overwrite the current one, just in case you want
     both to be output
   - Latent heat flux is a meteorological field (discipline=0)
   - Latent heat flux is a temperature product (category=0)
   - Pick an unused parameter number from the table defined by discipline=0 and
     category=0 (Table 4.2-0-0: http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/grib2/grib2_table4-
     2-0-0.shtml). In this case, the unused parameter number 205 was chosen.
   - Add using the NCEP local table (table=1)
   - Choose an abbreviated parameter name to describe your field (e.g. ACLHF)
   - Add as:
     0 0 205 1 ACLHF

7. Add the new variable to the /UPPV3.2/parm/post_avblflds.xml, which lists all fields available
   for output in GRIB2 format.
   - Post_avblfldidx: the unique array number given in the RQSTFLD.f routine.
   - Shortname: name describing the variable and level type
   - Pname: the abbreviation for your variable
   - Table info: table used if not standard WMO
   - Fixed_sfc1_type: level type
   - Scale: precision of data written out to grib2 file

   User procedure:
   - Add as:
     <param>
       <post_avblfldidx>950</post_avblfldidx>
       <shortname>ACC_LATENT_HEAT_FLUX_ON_SURFACE</shortname>
       <pname>ACLHF</pname>
       <table_info>NCEP</table_info>
       <fixed_sfc1_type>surface</fixed_sfc1_type>
       <scale>4.0</scale>
     </param>

8. Add the new variable to the /UPPV4.1/parm/postcntrl.xml file, which lists all fields and levels
   you wish to output for GRIB2. Remake the /UPPV4.1/parm/postxconfig-NT.txt file, which
   contains the information from the xml that UPP reads.
   - See the User’s guide on steps for creating the text control file
   
   User procedure:
   - Add as:
     <param>
       <shortname>ACC_LATENT_HEAT_FLUX_ON_SURFACE</shortname>
       <pname>ACLHF</pname>
       <scale>4.0</scale>
     </param>

9. Run clean on the code and recompile the code to include the changes before running your
   UPP run script.
   
   User procedure:
     >> ./clean -a
     >> ./configure
     >> ./compile >& compile.log &

10. Assuming the modified code compiled successfully and you were able to produce grib
    output, you can check the grib file for your new variable.

    GRIB2 output of the new variable from this example procedure (using the wgrib2 utility if
    available on your system).
    - The new variable will not be defined by the variable name. Instead it will be defined
    using the grib2 parameter information you entered into params_grib2_tbl_new from
    step 7 of this procedure.

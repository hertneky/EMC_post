Code Overview
*************

The UPP can be used to post-process WRF-ARW, WRF-NMM, NMMB, GFS, CFS, and FV3 forecasts with current support available for FV3 only. It can ingest FV3 history files in netCDF and binarynemsiompiio format.

Unipost Functionalities:

   -  Interpolates the forecasts from the models native vertical
      coordinate to NWS standard output levels (e.g., pressure, height)
      and computes mean sea level pressure. If the requested parameter
      is on a models native level, then no vertical interpolation is
      performed.

   -  Computes diagnostic output quantities (e.g., convective available
      potential energy, helicity, relative humidity). A full list of
      fields that can be generated by :bolditalic:`unipost` is provided in
      :doc:`UPP_GRIB2_Table`.

   -  Outputs the results in NWS and WMO standard GRIB2 format (for GRIB
      documentation, see http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/docs/).
